                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lock, Stock and Barrel specializes in the acquisition and disposition of firearms, firearm paraphernalia,
                        reloading equipment and military/war memorabilia. We acquire items of any vintage, and any condition, from
                        individuals and estates nationwide for any liquidation purpose. We will purchase or consign single items or
                        entire collections – with a proven track record of achieving better than market prices for our sellers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lock, Stock &amp; Barrel was started by Spencer Hoglund, a noted firearms collector, researcher and a World
                        Champion
                        Cowboy Shooter. Spencer realized gun owners were in need of an honest and reliable destination for selling
                        their
                        guns and related items. Lock, Stock &amp; Barrel has grown to be the largest auction house of its kind on the West
                        Coast.
