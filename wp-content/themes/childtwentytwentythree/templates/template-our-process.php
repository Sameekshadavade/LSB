                    <p>
                        The Process begins with you contacting us to schedule a dropoff of the merchandise, or a pickup at your
                        location. We will provide you an auction appraisal based on recent sales of similar items. Once you have had
                        an
                        opportunity to review the market value of your items, you will have the option to either sell your items
                        directly to us, or consign them into one of our auctions.

                    <p>
                        California requires a 30-day hold on firearms received for resale, this period begins when the firearms are
                        cataloged in our office. During this time, the State runs a stolen gun search on each serial number and
                        removes
                        any record of the gun being in your possession. The guns need not be registered to you, they will clear the
                        30-day hold so long as they have not previously been reported stolen.

                    <p>
                        Once the guns clear the 30-day hold, they are handed off to our research and descriptions staff and then on to
                        our photography department. We have a full team of writers using extensive libraries of data, we will
                        carefully
                        identify and describe your guns, pointing out any and all details about your gun and its history. After the
                        descriptions, the guns will go to our photo studio for a full set of high quality images.

                        Now that your guns have been described and photographed, the guns will be posted to the auction block on the
                        date that we committed to you when we originally took possession. These auctions will run for 14 days, where
                        they can be viewed by over 3 Million monthly site visitors, as well as the direct marketing to our network of
                        tens of thousands of LSB repeat buyers. Our process ensures that online search engines will locate your
                        auction
                        listings and direct online buyers to the available auctions.
