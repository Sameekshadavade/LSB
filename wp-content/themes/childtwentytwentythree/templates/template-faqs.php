                                        <p>If you purchase a gun from another online seller, dealer, or auction, we can handle the transfer of the firearm. We CANNOT accept any firearm that is considered an Assault Weapon in California, if you need to ask – the answer is likely no. We also DO NOT accept transfers on AR or AK type rifles. We are not that kind of shop. Additionally, transfers are reserved for customers familiar with the California Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale and the relevant Exemptions. Make sure you can actually register the gun you bought.</p>
