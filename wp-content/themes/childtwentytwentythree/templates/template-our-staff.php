                    <p>Nanci comes to LSB through her lovely daughter Alyse who is married to the CEO, Spencer. She had retired after thirty plus years in Human Resources when Spencer saw rapid growth occurring and he knew he needed an on-site experienced HR professional to help with HR so he offered Nanci a part time position. The rest of her time is spent with Alyse and Spencer’s son, Walker and her other grandchildren. When she’s not being “Noni” she can be found on the Pickleball court.</p>

When he's not at work you can find him outside hiking or indoors hunched over a board game. Almost every department has tried to steal him so far, but shipping is holding on to this valuable team player.</p>
