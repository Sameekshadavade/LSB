<p>I’ve been doing business with the fine folks at Lock Stock and Barrel Investments for 
    several years and they continue to impress me with their professionalism, expertise, 
    and integrity.  I’ve sold several firearms through their auction process and have always
     profited from the experience.  Recently I recommended LS&B to a family friend who had
      a sizable collection she wanted appraised.  They came to her home,
       showed great respect for her late husband’s prized firearms and gave an honest appraisal.  
       Due to the outstanding impression they left with her she chose to dispose of his collection 
       though LS&B and has thanked me profusely for putting her in touch with them.  For those who
        may not be firearm savvy and have acquired firearms through inheritance or circumstance and 
        don’t know what they have or what to do with them, give Lock Stock and Barrel a call.  
        You’ll be in good hands.I’ve been doing business with the fine folks at Lock Stock and Barrel Investments for several years and they continue to impress me with their professionalism, expertise, and integrity.
