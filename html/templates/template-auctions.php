                    <p>
                        With very rare exception, all of our items are offered to the open market at no reserve and no
                        starting price. We sell with zero buyer&rsquo;s premium, so you only pay your high bid, shipping
                        and sales tax (when applicable) – <em>NO HIDDEN OR ADDED FEES.</em>

                    <p>
                        We list all of our firearms on Gunbroker.com at 14-day auctions, completely turning over the
                        inventory every two weeks. You will see 600-700 firearms listed at a time, selling on Sunday
                        nights, at which time the new batch goes up. Be sure to check back at least once every two weeks
                        so nothing gets by you.

                        Everything but guns and ammo can be found on eBay.com. From reloading equipment, holsters,
                        scopes & gun parts to militaria and collectibles, you will find it on Ebay. We run 10-day
                        auctions here, with about 500 items beginning every other Thursday and selling two Sundays
                        later. We promise 1-2 day shipping on your eBay purchases and will eventually have whatever it
                        is you have been looking for.

                        Ammo & Reloading components are listed on GunBroker.com. These auctions run on the same
                        schedule, listing and selling concurrently with our gun auctions. So whether you are looking for
                        single and rare cartridges, cases of shootable ammo or bullets, brass & components for
                        reloading, we will have it for sale in our ammo auctions.
